#' CBTF: Caught by the Fuzz! A minimalistic fuzz-test runner
#'
#' This package implements a very simple mechanism for fuzz-testing functions
#' in the public interface of an R package.
#'
#' Fuzz testing helps identify functions lacking sufficient argument validation,
#' and uncovers sets of inputs that, while valid by function signature, may
#' cause issues within the function body.
#'
#' The core functionality of the package is in [fuzz], which calls each
#' provided function with a certain input and records the output produced.
#' If an error or a warning is generated, this is captured and reported to the
#' user, unless it matches a pattern of whitelisted messages. The objects
#' returned by [fuzz] can be inspected with [summary.cbtf] and [print.cbtf].
#'
#' Whitelisting can also be done after a fuzz run has been completed via the
#' [whitelist] function, so that only messages that need to be acted upon are
#' actually shown. Using [whitelist] has the advantage of not requiring the
#' completion of a fuzz run of all functions over all inputs again.
#'
#' The helper function [get_exported_functions] identifies the functions
#' in the public interface of a given package, facilitating the generation of
#' the list of functions to be fuzzed.
#'
#' The helper function [test_inputs] is invoked by [fuzz] if the user doesn't
#' specify the set of inputs to be tested. By default generates a large set of
#' potentially problematic inputs, but these can be limited just to the
#' desired classes of inputs.
#'
#' The helper function [namify] can be used to generate automatically pretty
#' names in the list of input object, which can improve the output, especially
#' when structures such as data frames, matrices, and more complex objects are
#' involved. These names are based on the deparsed representation of the
#' unevaluated inputs.
