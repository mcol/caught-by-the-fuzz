The `CBTF` package implements a very simple mechanism for fuzz-testing
functions in the public interface of an R package.

Fuzz testing helps identify functions that lack sufficient argument validation,
and uncovers sets of inputs that, while valid by function signature, may
cause issues within the function body.

The core functionality of the package is in the `fuzz()` function, which calls
each provided function with a certain input and records the output produced.
If an error or a warning is generated, this is captured and reported to the
user, unless it matches a pattern of whitelisted messages, as specified in
the `ignore_patterns` argument. The objects returned by `fuzz()` can be
inspected with `summary()` and `print()`.

Whitelisting can also be done after a fuzz run has been completed via the
`whitelist()` function, so that only messages that need to be acted upon are
actually shown. Using `whitelist()` has the advantage of not requiring to run
the fuzzer over all functions and all inputs again.

Note that `fuzz()` uses the [`mirai` package](https://mirai.r-lib.org/) for
asynchronous operations and parallelisation, and execution occurs on persistent
background processes. These can be started automatically by specifying the
`daemons` option; alternatively, they can be set up manually with the
`mirai::daemons()` function; refer to the original `mirai` documentation for
a complete description of its arguments and behaviour.

The helper function `get_exported_functions()` identifies the functions
in the public interface of a given package, facilitating the generation of
the list of functions to be fuzzed.

The helper function `test_inputs()` is invoked by `fuzz()` if the user doesn't
specify the set of inputs to be tested. By default it generates a large set of
potentially problematic inputs, but these can be limited just to the desired
classes of inputs.

## Usage

```{r, echo = FALSE}
## don't print the progress messages, as `\r` is badly supported here
withr::local_envvar(c(R_CLI_DYNAMIC="FALSE"))
```

This is a simple example that displays how to use `CBTF` to fuzz an R package.
We consider `mime` because it is small enough to run quickly and is likely
installed on most systems.

```{r}
library(CBTF)
funs <- get_exported_functions("mime")
(res <- fuzz(funs, what = list(TRUE)))
```

The first occurrence is a false positive, as the message returned indicates
that the input was checked and the function returned cleanly. The second case
instead reveals that the function didn't validate its input: indeed, it
expected an environment, and used the `$` operation on it without checking.

The false positive result can be easily removed by whitelisting an appropriate
pattern:
```{r}
whitelist(res, "a character vector argument expected")
```

### Fuzzing multiple arguments

The example above didn't specify the `args` argument, and therefore only the
first function argument was fuzzed. By setting `args`, it's possible to
provide a list of arguments (of any length) to pass to the functions being
fuzzed.

To fuzz the first three arguments of `matrix()` (`data`, `nrow` and `ncol`),
we could do the following:
```{r}
fuzz("matrix", what = list(NA, NULL), args = list(1:4, 2, 2))
```

If names are given to elements in `args`, they will be used in the input lists
generated. This can be helpful to fuzz a specific argument across several
function, or to fuzz an argument that comes later in the argument list or that
are passed via `...`.

For example, the following will fuzz the `data`, `nrow` and `dimnames`
arguments:
```{r}
fuzz("matrix", what = list(NA, NULL), args = list(1:4, 2, dimnames = NULL))
```

Fuzzing is generally more effective when the values in `args` provide a good
default for the functions being fuzzed; while an argument is being fuzzed, the
others remain valid, allowing for a broader exploration of the argument space.

However, this is not strictly necessary (and may not be achievable when
fuzzing multiple functions simultaneously). Additionally, some code paths may
only be reached through combinations of invalid values that would otherwise
remain unexplored.

## Advanced topics

### Generated argument lists

Either `args` or `what` can be `NULL`, but not both. The most basic use sets
`args = NULL`, in which case each of the inputs in `what` is assigned to the
first argument of each function being fuzzed. For example, if
`what = list(NA, "")`, then the following input lists will be generated:

- `list(NA)`
- `list("")`

If instead `what = NULL`, the exact argument list defined in `args` will be
tested on all functions without any fuzzing. This can be useful after a fuzz
run to collect results on a specific set of problematic inputs, or to monitor
progress while addressing the bugs discovered during the fuzzing process.

However, the full potential of `CBTF` is realised by specifying both `what`
(or leaving it unset, which deploys the full range of inputs generated by
`test_inputs()`) and `args`. In such cases, `args` is expanded internally into
multiple lists, each differing by one elements modified according to an
element in `what`.

For example, if `what = list(NA, "")` and `args = list(x = 11, y = 22, 33)`,
the following input lists will be generated and tested:

- `list(x = NA, y = 22, 33)`
- `list(x = "", y = 22, 33)`
- `list(x = 11, y = NA, 33)`
- `list(x = 11, y = "", 33)`
- `list(x = 11, y = 22, NA)`
- `list(x = 11, y = 22, "")`

Sometimes it may be helpful to specify an argument ho have a fixed value, so
that it remains unchanged while fuzzing. This can be done by prepending ".."
to the argument name. For example, to fix argument `x` at 11, we would use
`args = list(..x = 11, y = 22, 33)`, and only these inputs will be tested:

- `list(x = 11, y = NA, 33)`
- `list(x = 11, y = "", 33)`
- `list(x = 11, y = 22, NA)`
- `list(x = 11, y = 22, "")`

### Parallel execution

The implementation of `fuzz()` uses the [`mirai` package](https://mirai.r-lib.org/)
for asynchronous operations and parallelisation. This allows to fuzz the
functions on persistent background processes (daemons) in parallel.

There are two main approaches to control parallel execution:

1. Setting the `daemons` argument to an integer value (2 by default): this
   will start as many daemons as specified (and shut them down automatically
   at the end of the fuzz run). Note that there is no
   benefit in starting more daemons than the number of available cores.
   ```{r, eval = FALSE}
   ## this will start 4 daemons
   res <- fuzz(funs, daemons = 4)
   ```

2. Manually setting up the daemons before the start of the function: this can
   be accomplished via `mirai::daemons()`, which allows to specify remote
   daemons as well as local one. This also avoids the cost of starting and
   closing daemons if `fuzz()` were to be called multiple times. It remains
   responsibility of the user to close the daemons when no longer in use. When
   active daemons are found, the `daemons` argument will be ignored. Refer
   to the original `mirai` documentation for a complete description of its
   arguments and behaviour.
   ```{r, eval = FALSE}
   ## set up persistent background processes on the local machine
   mirai::daemons(4)
   res <- fuzz(funs)

   ## close the background processes
   mirai::daemons(0)
   ```

### Timeouts

Long-running functions can slow down the progress of `fuzz()`, so by default
if a function does not produce an error within 2 seconds, it will be stopped.
A timed out function returns an `"OK"` result, with the corresponding `$msg`
field recording that a timeout was applied.

However, the default timeout may be too short (or perhaps too long) in some
applications. If desired, the maximum running time of a job (in seconds) can
be controlled via the `timeout` argument of `fuzz()`

### Controlling the inputs tested

By default, `fuzz()` tests all the inputs produced by `test_inputs()`
(currently `r length(test_inputs())` inputs).
However, this can be controlled by specifying the classes that should be
tested:
```{r, results = "hide"}
test_inputs(use = c("scalar", "numeric", "integer", "matrix"))
```

Alternatively, one can specify the classes to be excluded:
```{r, results = "hide"}
test_inputs(skip = c("date", "raw"))
```

A vector of valid classes can be retrieved programmatically by setting this
argument to "help":
```{r}
test_inputs("help")
```

### Fuzzing list inputs automatically

It is trivial to augment a given set of inputs with list versions of the same.
This effectively doubles the number of tests run with no additional coding
effort.
```{r}
fuzz(funs, what = list(letters), listify_what = TRUE)
```
