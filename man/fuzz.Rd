\usage{
fuzz(
  funs,
  what,
  package = NULL,
  ignore.patterns = NULL,
  ignore.warnings = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{funs}{A character vector of function names to test. If a \code{"package"}
attribute is set, the functions are loaded directly from the package
namespace; otherwise, the functions are searched in the global
namespace.}

\item{what}{A list objects to be passed, one at a time, as first argument
to each of the functions in \code{funs}. Ideally, the list should be
named, allowing each input tested to be pretty-printed with the name
provided. If the list is not named, a deparsed representation of the
input will be displayed, which may look unwieldy in some cases.}

\item{package}{A character string specifying the name of the package to
search for function names. If \code{NULL} (default), the function will
first attempt to use the \code{"package"} attribute of \code{funs}, and if
that is not set, names will be searched in the global namespace.}

\item{ignore.patterns}{A character string containing a regular expression
to match the messages to ignore.}

\item{ignore.warnings}{Whether warnings should be ignored (\code{FALSE} by
default).}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{cbtf} that stores the results obtained for each of the
functions tested.
}
\description{
This function calls each of the functions it receives with each of the
objects specified in \code{what}.
}
