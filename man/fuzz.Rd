fuzz(
  funs,
  what = test_inputs(),
  package = NULL,
  listify_what = FALSE,
  ignore_patterns = "",
  ignore_warnings = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{funs}{A character vector of function names to test. If a \code{"package"}
attribute is set, the functions are loaded from that package's
namespace; otherwise, they are searched in the global namespace.}

\item{what}{A list of objects to be passed, one at a time, as the first
argument to each function in \code{funs}. Ideally, the list should be
named, so that each input tested can be pretty-printed with the
corresponding name. For unnamed lists, a deparsed representation of
the inputs will be used, which may appear unwieldy in some cases.
If nothing is provided, a default set of inputs generated by
\code{\link[=test_inputs]{test_inputs()}} will be used.}

\item{package}{A character string specifying the name of the package to
search for functions. If \code{NULL} (default), the function will first
check the \code{"package"} attribute of \code{funs}, and if that is not set,
names will be searched in the global namespace.}

\item{listify_what}{Whether each input in \code{what} should also be tested
in its listified version (\code{FALSE} by default). When set to \code{TRUE},
if \code{what} is \code{list(x = x)}, the function will operate as if \code{what}
were \code{list(x = x, "list(x)" = list(x))}, for any input object \code{x}.}

\item{ignore_patterns}{One or more strings containing regular expressions
to match the errors to ignore. The string "is missing, with no
default" is always ignored.}

\item{ignore_warnings}{Whether warnings should be ignored (\code{FALSE} by
default).}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{cbtf} that stores the results obtained for each of the
functions tested.
}
\description{
This function calls each of the functions it receives with each of the
objects specified in \code{what}.
}
