\title{CBTF: Caught by the Fuzz! A minimal fuzz-test runner}
\description{
This package implements a very simple mechanism for fuzz-testing functions
in the public interface of an R package.
}
\details{
Fuzz testing can be used in the first instance to identify functions that
do not have sufficient argument validation. Besides, fuzz testing can
identify sets of inputs that, while satisfying the implicit typing of a
function signature, are problematic inside the function body. These often
concern presence of missing values, \code{NULL} entries, dimensionality- or
sign-related errors.

The core functionality of the package is \code{\link[=fuzz]{fuzz()}}, whose aim is to call
each provided function with a certain input and record the output produced.
If an error is generated, this is captured and reported to the user, unless
the error message matches a pattern of whitelisted errors.

The helper function \code{\link[=get_exported_functions]{get_exported_functions()}} identifies the functions
in the public interface of a given package, facilitating the generation of
the list of functions to be fuzzed.
